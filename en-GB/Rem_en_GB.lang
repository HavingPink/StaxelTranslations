staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000100=Oh! I...I didn't expect to see you here... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000200=Uh... How did you even get here? Those devices are one time use and rather hard to make... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000300=It was that ^c:1486b0;scientist^c:pop;, wasn't it? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000400=I just wanted to bring ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; back, you know? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000500=We all wanted that, but he just wouldn't come...kept talking about duty in his letters... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000600=It was really hard to build something that could transfer objects from place to place! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000700=It was one-time-use too... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000800=How did she even fix it? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000900=Well never mind. You're here now. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001000=At least one of you came willingly... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001100=I'm here to bring ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; back.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001200=Oh... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001300=I shouldn't really help you, but... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001400=It's hard to see him so distressed. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001500=Perhaps it was truly wrong of me to drag him back. Maybe he'll come back of his own free will someday... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001600=Alright. I'll help you. It won't be easy though... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001700=We didn't want him to run away so we moved him somewhere...special...for the time being. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001800=If you could get me a few items I should be able to pull together something that will whisk you past the barrier. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001900=There should be ^c:d03e37;five components^c:pop;. If you look around the ^c:1486b0;tree houses^c:pop; here you should find them. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002000=We shouldn't be seen talking until you find the ^c:d03e37;five components^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002100=It would be bad if they suspected something was happening... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002200=Yes, this looks like everything we need! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002300=Now if you just give me a minu- 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002400=I apologise, the device initiated before I was quite ready. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002500=I hope I didn't cause you too much unnecessary concern...? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002510=That's great, we need to figure out where they went. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002520=Could you have a look at ^c:1486b0;Town Hall^c:pop; and the ^c:1486b0;Museum^c:pop;? There may be clues there. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003000=It's really important! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003100=Please come back to me soon. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003200=We should have spent more time with ^c:1486b0;Tomti^c:pop;.. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003300=I hope you find him. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003310=Hi ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! I was looking for you! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003320=I did not expect to be visiting you here after that previous... situation. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003330=In general I don't actually leave ^c:1486b0;Treetop Village^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003335=Too much I need to be doing.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003340=But, there might be a slight problem. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003350=Remember that teleporter I used to bring ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; home? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003360=Well...my brother ^c:1486b0;Tomti^c:pop; took it... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003370=We don't know where he could have gone, he hasn't been around for a while. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003380=We've all been so busy, and with ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; not staying around and all... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003390=Anyways, uh... he took ^c:1486b0;Maximilian^c:pop; with him. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003400=Maybe he's a bit lonely I... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003410=I think he took  ^c:1486b0;Vorlen^c:pop; as well. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003420=Can you help me look for clues? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003800=Yes!
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003900=Not right now.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004000=Could you please help find ^c:1486b0;Tomti^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004100=Yes!
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004200=Not right now.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004300=Have you managed to find anything? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004400=Hopefully we can find a clue to their whereabouts... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004500=You found something, great! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004600=It looks like a fragment of... a portal maybe. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004700=If you can find another piece, it might give us more to go on! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004800=Great! This is really good, they still look alright. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004900=I will quickly assemble these back together... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10005000=I figured... Since ^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop; managed last time... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10005100=I don't know how she did it, you may want to ask her for help.
