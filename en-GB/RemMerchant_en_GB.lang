staxel.village.dialogue.RemMerchant.line:10000100=Hey ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.RemMerchant.line:10000200=^c:1486b0;Tomti^c:pop; and I have been talking. 
staxel.village.dialogue.RemMerchant.line:10000300=I could not convince him to stay at the ^c:1486b0;Treetop Village^c:pop; 
staxel.village.dialogue.RemMerchant.line:10000400=He never felt at home there. 
staxel.village.dialogue.RemMerchant.line:10000500=But living in the caves as he did, that's not healthy. 
staxel.village.dialogue.RemMerchant.line:10000600=He needs people around him, especially kind people like you. 
staxel.village.dialogue.RemMerchant.line:10000700=So, we decided it would be best for him to make a life here, and make friends with the other villagers. 
staxel.village.dialogue.RemMerchant.line:10000800=Meanwhile, there's a bunch of items just collecting dust at that other world. 
staxel.village.dialogue.RemMerchant.line:10000900=I figured, why not sell them! 
staxel.village.dialogue.RemMerchant.line:10001000=We could use a bit of income at the ^c:1486b0;Treetop Village^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.RemMerchant.line:10001100=I can also keep a bit of an eye out on ^c:1486b0;Tomti^c:pop; myself this way. And see ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; occasionally! 
staxel.village.dialogue.RemMerchant.line:10001200=Anyways, have a look around, see if there's anything you like! 
staxel.village.dialogue.RemMerchant.line:10001300=I am happy to see ^c:1486b0;Tomti^c:pop; excited to be around people at last. 
staxel.village.dialogue.RemMerchant.line:10001400=Anything you like ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? I will be back again another day.
