staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009500=Hi ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009600=It looks like you've achieved some interesting new feats! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009700=These are from the town to commemorate the occasion! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009800=Don't forget to visit me again next time! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006974=Hmm? Who might you be? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007074=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop; you say? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007174=Let me see... doesn't look like you're on my list! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007274=I'm guessing you're a friend of the farm's new owner? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007374=Welcome to the village! I hope you enjoy your stay! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007378=... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007382=Still here? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007386=Well I guess I could give you a small welcome package... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007388=Just don't go telling anyone about this... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10013600=^c:1486b0;Butterflies^c:pop;? I'm really more into the farming side of things... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10013700=But I guess I've seen ^c:1486b0;blue butterflies^c:pop;, ^c:1486b0;pink butterflies^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10013800=^c:1486b0;Purple butterflies^c:pop;, ^c:1486b0;white butterflies^c:pop;...oh, ^c:1486b0;yellow butterflies^c:pop; too. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10013900=Does that answer your question? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014000=^c:1486b0;Rowan's^c:pop; looking for a part-time helper, is he? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014100=Do you think he'd let me drink as much ^c:d03e37;sap^c:pop; as I want on the job? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014200=Tell him I'm on board if he will! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014300=Oh, I remember this. I think I gave ^c:1486b0;Oscar^c:pop; this ^c:d03e37;broom^c:pop; for one of his birthdays... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014400=I see he's managed to make you into his lackey! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014500=I was hoping to do that first... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014600=Here to participate in the harvest festival? Let me just give you a quick rundown of the rules! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014700=This is a produce-growing competition! Bring in the best of your crops and win a prize! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014800=If you're lucky, you might find yourself the grand prize winner! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014900=How nice! You win a {0-reward}! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015000=I've seen better...but it's not a bad specimen. Here's a {0-reward} for your efforts! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015100=Hey, so want me to let you in on a little secret? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015200=I've been so excited about this amazing new crop I discovered, but I haven't been able to get away... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015300=I wanted to take part in the contest, not handle it! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015400=But maybe you can do it for me instead? I just want to see the crop win! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015500=If you plant these ^c:1486b0;seeds^c:pop;, I guarantee you'll get a crop that no one can beat! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015600=You'll never have seen anything like it before! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015700=Wow! Now that is one massive ^c:1486b0;turnip^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015800=I don't think I've ever seen anything this impressive before in my life! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015900=Whoever came up with this crop must have been a true genius, I'm sure! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016000=That ^c:1486b0;voucher^c:pop; entitles you to the grand prize. No one is going to beat that! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016100=Take it over to ^c:1486b0;{0-max}^c:pop;—he wanted to keep an eye on that one himself! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016200=Hey there, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016300=How's it going down at the farm? Pretty good I hope? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016400=You moving in there has been a little bit of a problem for me after all... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016500=Oh, not that I mean to accuse you or anything...I was technically just squatting after all. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016600=But it does mean I don't really have anywhere to live right now. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016700=The ^c:1486b0;tavern^c:pop; is okay, but it does get a bit crowded with ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; around at night. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016800=And I get the feeling ^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop; doesn't likely leaving me unattended in his establishment... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016900=So what do you say? Feeling up to building me a house? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017000=This ^c:d03e37;mailbox^c:pop; will designate the house as being mine once it's complete! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017100=I hope I can count on you! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017200=Still working on my house I hope? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017300=Alternatively I can just move back in at your place? No? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017400=Nice, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Very nice! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017500=Now I won't have to sleep in the ^c:1486b0;tavern^c:pop; with one eye open any more! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017600=This is just a little reward to congratulate you on a job well done. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017700=Thanks for all your help! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017800=Hey, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, how's the farm? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017900=I'm still trying to get properly settled in to my new home. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018000=It's just...I think I'm too used to sleeping with all the farm memorabilia around... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018100=It's surprisingly hard to fall asleep without them! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018200=Maybe you could help me by tracking down some old bits and pieces around the island? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018300=Just a few things that are very collectable, you know? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018400=I'd settle for a ^c:d03e37;star jelly^c:pop;, a ^c:d03e37;fossilised slime^c:pop;, and a ^c:d03e37;paw shell^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018500=Do you think you can manage that? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018600=Nice! This is a really good start! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018700=I hope you're all warmed up now because the next ones are going to be a bit tougher! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018800=A long time ago, there was an ^c:d03e37;old tractor^c:pop; that got stuck in a ditch somewhere around here. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018900=I think if you went mining a few ^c:d03e37;fossil rocks^c:pop; you might be able to come across some parts of it. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019000=I think a ^c:d03e37;star jelly^c:pop;, a ^c:d03e37;fossilised slime^c:pop;, and a ^c:d03e37;paw shell^c:pop; would help me feel a bit more at home. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019100=Think you can get all of those? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019200=Oooh, yes! This is a wonderful piece of memorabilia! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019300=While you were out digging that up, I remembered something else. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019400=There were some ^c:d03e37;old tools^c:pop; the previous owner used to use a lot. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019500=I think he lost some of them in one of the ^c:1486b0;lakes^c:pop;. Maybe you could fish them up? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019600=Any luck find parts of that ^c:d03e37;old tractor^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019700=I imagine you might be able to dig them up by mining a few ^c:d03e37;fossil rocks^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019800=Yes, these are the ones I remember! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019900=A bit rusty maybe, but they're definitely very collectable! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020000=Now, there's just one last thing... It might be the most important thing too... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020100=There's a limited-time online auction running for some really rare pieces of memorabilia... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020200=Items that belonged to legendary farmers who changed the world! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020300=The trouble is...they're a bit expensive... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020400=Do you think you could put together ^c:d03e37;{0-currency}10,000,000^c:pop; over the next two days? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020500=I understand if you can't, but still... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020600=Did you manage to fish up any of the ^c:d03e37;old tools^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020700=I know they fell into one of the ^c:1486b0;lakes^c:pop; around here. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020800=There's still time left, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020900=You can still gather the money! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021000=Well...it looks like we couldn't raise the money in time... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021100=But...that's okay I suppose. I heard ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; was the one who actually won it... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021200=So perhaps we could still try reasoning with him? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021300=He wouldn't say anything about it? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021400=Oh well... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021500=I suppose I'll keep looking for other things... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021600=Thanks for helping me out so far though! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021700=Hi, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021800=I think ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; said he wanted to see you whenever you're free... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021900=^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; told me to send you over if you came on by. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022000=Hmm? ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? My birthday? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022100=Oh...I suppose that is coming up, isn't it? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022200=You want to give everything to me now? Well I'm not about to say no! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022300=Oh! I've been searching for a copy of this book for years! Where did you find it? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022400=Oh oh! And is this that item ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; won on auction? He bought it for me? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022500=You baked the ^c:d03e37;cake^c:pop;, you say? I'm sure it will be delicious! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022600=Although...it looks like you didn't quite know what name to put on the cake... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022700=Thank you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! People don't usually want to celebrate my birthday... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022800=Could you pass on my thanks to ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; as well? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022900=I think I want to keep admiring my presents... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023000=Hi, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023100=I've been keeping an eye on your progress and it looks like you've really settled in. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023200=This is a wonderful island, right? Do you think you're ready for the ultimate test? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023300=At some point, everyone has to go through this to prove just how much they know about the island! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023400=Before you arrived, I hid ^c:d03e37;13 bobbleheads^c:pop; around the village! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023500=If you can find them all and show them to me, I'll acknowledge that you know the village like the back of your hand. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023600=It doesn't matter what order you bring them in, just head out and find them! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023700=He talked a lot about landscape and terrain, especially beaches. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023800=Maybe he was a painter? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023900=I'd love to get her to design me a furniture set someday! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024000=Custom made is always the best! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024100=Before I met this one, I was a little less sarcastic... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024200=I wonder what that means? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024300=I see him running around everywhere! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024400=I think he puts out newsletters and things like that a lot too. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024500=He's an artist! I think everyone in the village likes wearing his branded clothes. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024600=If memory serves, he makes lots of really cool music! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024700=Maybe we can get him to come play a live concert or something? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024800=He's the one who makes everything around here work. Literally everything. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024900=He works a lot with sounds. They really make games come alive! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025000=He claims to exist only when you're not looking... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025100=But I'm absolutely sure I've seen him around a few times... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025200=Hmm... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025300=Something about this ^c:d03e37;bobblehead^c:pop; seems missing... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025400=I heard he invented the ^c:d03e37;sprinkler^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025500=We could definitely use more of those around here! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025600=He's the architect who built all the houses in the village! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025700=Nothing has fallen down yet! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025800=He does a lot of work in marketing! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025900=Maybe he could help getting more visitors interested in our festivals? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026000=Oh, you found another ^c:d03e37;bobblehead^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026100=Let me see! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026200=Ahh, I remember this one... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026300=So I think that just leaves ^c:d03e37;{0-remainingBobbleheads} bobbleheads^c:pop; to go! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026400=Oh, I think that's all of them! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026500=Wow. I didn't think you'd actually manage to find them all! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026600=Even I forgot where I put most of them... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026700=I suppose that means you're the one who knows this village the best! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026800=You've definitely come a long way since you first got here. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026900=I still remember the day you arrived...showing you the ropes. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10027000=Who knew you'd surpass me this quickly? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10027100=I still remember the day you arrived...when you told me you were already a licensed farmer. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10027200=It was exciting to have another expert around! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10027300=If you're ever lonely on that farm, just know that I'd still love to live there! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10027400=You can ask me any time!

staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10001100=Welcome to Staxel! I'm ^c:1486b0;Farm Fan^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10001200=^c:1486b0;Mayor Max^c:pop; told me you're moving in to take over this old farm. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10001300=It's fallen into a bit of disrepair, but I can't wait to see what you do with the place! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10001400=You know, I prepared a bit of a welcome care pack for you, but in all the excitement I left it at the store… 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10001500=Do you think you could go pick it up from the ^c:1486b0;General Store^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10001600=Wow thanks, sure! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10001700=Alright... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10001800=Empty Text 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002000=You can find ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop;'s store in town. It’s the big blue building near the town center. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002100=Don't forget... you can check your ^c:1486b0;Map^c:pop; if you're lost. You remember how to use it, right? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002200=Nope... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002300=Sure do! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10001900=Great! ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; should have it. All you need to do is check your ^c:1486b0;Map^c:pop; and you should find him.
