staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10002300=It's important, because now you know what to bring for my birthday! 
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10002400=That is... If I invite you.  
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10002500=We don't truely know each other yet. 
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10002600=For that you have to know my other friends too. 
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10002700=I've got many friends, they're all here in my lair. But... 
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10002800=There is one friend that steals the spotlight, who is it? 
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10002900=Good!

staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10003100=I want my friends to always feel at home. 
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10003200=So... I have made sure there is enough toilets! 
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10003300=You never know when it breaks. That would be awkward!  
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10003400=I'm thinking of getting one more... Just in case...
