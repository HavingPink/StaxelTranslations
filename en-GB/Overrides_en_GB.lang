switch.staxel.mail.BestFriendOptions=Hello, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!\n\nIt sounds like you've been getting on very well with some of the people around here! Perhaps it's time for you to take things to the next level... By that, of course, I mean becoming roomies!\n\nI've included a small package with this mail. You'll find a ^c:d03e37;farmhouse signpost^c:pop; and a ^c:d03e37;friendship bracelet^c:pop; attached. The whole thing works quite simply: all you need to do is set up the ^c:d03e37;signpost^c:pop; in front of your home, like you would any other structure. Then, when you ^c:1486b0;gift^c:pop; the ^c:d03e37;friendship bracelet^c:pop; to your new best friend, they'll have somewhere to move in!\n\nBest of luck!\n\n^c:1486b0;Maximilian^c:pop;\nOffice of the Mayor
switch.staxel.mail.CecileArrival=Greetings!\n\nI wanted to extend my thanks to you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, for erecting a suitable house for me in the village. It's been a few decades since my family left our ancestral home, but for various reasons, I have decided to move my lab back to somewhere more remote. Entirely normal reasons, I assure you.\n\nWould you be interested in a possible research position? I'm certain we could come to some sort of arrangement we would both find agreeable. I do imagine I will call upon you to help out with a few of my experiments—in a safe and controlled manner, of course.\n\nRegards,\n^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop;
