staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008300=I've been thinkin' a lot recently... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008400=My store could be doin' so much better. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008500=If only there was less competition, if ya catch my drift... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008600=Take out Leif? Got it.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008700=...what?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009300=How's the whole expansion thing goin'? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009400=We're gonna blow ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; outta the water! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008800=Naw, don't get the wrong idea! ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; is a good friend! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008900=We ain't gonna do anythin' bad to him...'cept maybe steal some of his customers. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009000=How are we gonna do that? Well, by stockin' up on all the stuff he has that we could! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009100=Oh, and quite a few bits he doesn't! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009200=I jus' need ya to expand the ^c:1486b0;buildin' store^c:pop; a bit so we can stock 'em! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009500=It's always impressive how quick ya get that stuff done, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009600=I swear, I jus' gotta blink and suddenly the work's all done! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009700=Maybe I'm jus' too used to the ol' style of contractors... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009800=Now, the job itself may be the main reward, but I thought I'd give ya a little somethin' extra! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009900=Let's see how well ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; does at outshinin' us now, eh? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010000=Hm? You wanna know about ^c:1486b0;Rosie's^c:pop; ol' rabbit? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010100='Fraid I wasn't in the neighbourhood back then... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010200=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, I hate to be the one to say this, but yer buildin' too much! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010300=At this rate, I'm never gonna be able to keep up with yer demand for resources! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010400=We jus' don' have the supplies... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010500=Now...if ya'd be willin' to help with tha', we might be able to change things for the better! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010600=How about ya start with a quick survey of the island as a whole? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010700=Jus' run around a bit an' bring me ^c:d03e37;50 raw stone^c:pop; an' ^c:d03e37;50 raw wood^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010800=See if ya can find some promisin' sources! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011100=Ah, so ya did manage to find some untapped sources, did ya? That's good to hear. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011200=Now, I can't exactly ask ya to bring all the materials in yerself. That'd be too much work! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011300=So what I want ya to do is take each o' these ^c:d03e37;markers^c:pop; and use 'em to designate a resource. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011400=Some o' them need trees, some need open quarries. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011500=Once they're all marked up, I can start plannin' better ways o' sourcin' 'em. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011600=Jus' lemme know when it's all set up! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010900=Any luck findin' us some new sources o' raw materials? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011000=Jus' wander a bit and see if ya can find a good place to get ^c:d03e37;50 raw stone^c:pop; an' ^c:d03e37;50 raw wood^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011900=There ya are, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012000=Jus' got word that some 'o my people are preparin' to work with those resources, ya marked! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012100=Good work out there! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012200=Seems like we're gonna be pretty good on materials for a while now! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012300=This' jus' a li'l somethin' as thanks fer savin' the business again! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012400=Even if ya were the one who put it at risk in the first place! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011700=Looks like we're missin' a few more resource spots. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011800=Ya jus' gotta place them ^c:d03e37;markers^c:pop; next to trees or quarries as the marker says and make sure they're valid! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012500=The time has come, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012600=We're gonna beat out my good-for-nothin' ex-husband for monopoly of all the islands in the region! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012700=It was my store that got 'im that big tradin' conglomerate in the first place! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012800=But it ain't gonna be easy. Not by far. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012900=I got a multi-step plan that's guaranteed to succeed, but a whole lot of it rests on yer shoulders! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013000=See, the biggest barrier to dominatin' the other islands is how much we can ship in an' outta the island. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013100=The bottleneck there is all in the ^c:1486b0;airship dock^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013200=If ya could expand both sides a bit, it'd be a great first step to ownin' the whole region! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013300=This should give ya a good idea about how to proceed! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013400=Still workin' on the ^c:1486b0;airship dock^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013500=Hard work, I'd imagine, eh? Yer doin' good though! Fantastic even! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013600=Good work, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Ya really nailed the expansion! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013700=Already got a bunch o' airships inbound to start ferryin' goods more efficiently! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013800=Trouble is...our airships aren't exactly the fastest out there... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013900=We're somethin' like 10-20% behind in terms o' speed compared to our competitors... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014000=Ya think ya could work somethin' up to fix the issue? Maybe some fancy new parts or somethin'? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014100=This here is an idea I had...but I ain't exactly figured out all the specifics... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014200=Maybe ya could run it on by ^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop;? Heard she was all big on science-like stuff. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014500=No dice, huh? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014600=Dunno why ^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop; is so stuck on magic not bein' real... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014700=Too many hours in the books, maybe? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014800=But if it's magic we need...maybe ya wanna go say hi to ^c:1486b0;Cirahna^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014900=She seems pretty in the know about magic, right? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015200=Better luck this time, I hope? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015300=Mmm... Yea, that makes more sense! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015400=Alright, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Ya up for a little craftin' work? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015500=We're gonna need two sets 'o ^c:d03e37;airship parts^c:pop; to get the things movin' faster! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015600=Don' worry too much about the instructions! It ain't as scary as it looks! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015700=Jus' do it one step at a time and yer gonna be fine! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014300=Could ya run that plan on by ^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014400=She might have some ideas on how to make it work. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015000=We need some magic, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015100=Go see if ^c:1486b0;Cirahna's^c:pop; willin' to help! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016000=These are perfect, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016100=Couldn't have made a better prototype myself! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016200=Now that just leaves one last teeny thing... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016300=See, the key to beatin' out that ol' thief's monopoly is bestin' 'im at 'is own game! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016400=We're gonna need somethin' to intercept all 'is communications an' beat 'im to the punch! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016500=Go set that up somewhere outside the village and I'll get these airships into production! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015800=Remember, we need two o' the ^c:1486b0;weird magic airship parts^c:pop; to make these things fly! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015900=Bring 'em on over as soon as yer done! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016600=That ^c:1486b0;communications tower^c:pop; is gonna be the key to our success! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016700=Make sure ya set it up somewhere it'll get good reception! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016800=Although, on this island, I suppose that's just about anywhere! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016900=Already got some communications comin' in! Good work, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! I knew I could count on ya! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017000=We're gonna dominate the market in no time! Maybe I'll even manage to buy my ol' business back from that greedy ol'... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017100=Anyhow, I hafta thank ya again, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. This wouldn't have been possible without ya! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017200=This is jus' a li'l token of my admiration for ya. And my undying thanks! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017300=If yer ever lookin' for someone to help around yer home, I'd always be willin'! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017400=Jus' come on by an' say the word! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017410=Oh, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! How fares th' ^c:1486b0;farm^c:pop;?

staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017500=Eh? What's this? A ^c:d03e37;broom^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017600=What is ol' ^c:1486b0;Oscar^c:pop; up to this time...? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017700=He better not be thinkin' any o' this is my fault... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017800=Construction's all lookin' pretty good!

staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10018300=A new idea ta bring money ta the town? Sounds pretty fancy! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10018400=Shouldn' be any problems on our end. Jus' run this ^c:1486b0;signpost^c:pop; back to 'im. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10018500=Then we're probably good ta go! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10007310=Alrighty, here ya go! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10007320=Alrighty, here ya go! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10007420=Alright there ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? How’s the day treatin’ yah? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10007520=A ^c:1486b0;Cow^c:pop; yah say… Sure we can get a ^c:1486b0;Barn^c:pop; built for it. No problemo! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10007620=First off you’ll be needin’ some ^c:1486b0;Lumber^c:pop; for the job. Hows about you take this ^c:1486b0;Axe^c:pop; and go chop down a couple of trees.  
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10007720=Come see me when yer done. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10007820=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop; yah ain’t got no wood yet? Just go swingin’ that axe at the nearest tree! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10007920=Nice one ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Now ta turn that wood into somethin’ useful for yer ^c:1486b0;Cow;^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008020=Here’s a ^c:1486b0;Blueprint^c:pop; for a ^c:1486b0;Trough^c:pop;...  
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008120=You'll need to turn that wood into ^c:1486b0;Lumber^c:pop; first at a ^c:1486b0;Table Saw^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008220=These materials should build ye one ^c:1486b0;Trough^c:pop;, you can buy the rest to make up another one in the ^c:1486b0;Building Store^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008320=You’ll need two troughs for a reasonable ^c:1486b0;Barn^c:pop;... come see me when you’ve made ‘em! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008420=Sup ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, ya need a refresher on craftin’? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008620=Yeah, Please!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008720=No, I've got this.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008820=Now that’s some fine craftsmanship!  
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008920=You’ll need to lay out a space for yer ^c:1486b0;Barn^c:pop; now… Take this ^c:1486b0;Barn Sign^c:pop; and plop it somewhere on yer farm. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009020=Building regulations require there to be at least 1 sign for every buildin’. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009120=So this sign’ll act as a marker for yer ^c:1486b0;Barn^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009220=Come see me when you’ve got that plopped down. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009320=Just chuck that ^c:1486b0;Barn Sign^c:pop; down somewhere then come talk ta me. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009420=Do ya need a refresher on signs? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009520=Yeah, Please!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009620=No, I've got this.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009720=Ah you found a good spot then ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009820=Now you’ll need to actually build the ^c:1486b0;Barn;^c:pop;. I was saving the easy part for last… haha! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009920=Don’t worry though, I’ve got a few spare materials here to help ye out. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010020=That should be enough to get it started, enough for one ^c:1486b0;Cow^c:pop; anyway! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010120=You should go see ^c:1486b0;Farm Fan^c:pop; when yer done, she’ll be wantin’ to offload that ^c:1486b0;Cow^c:pop; soon, I’ll bet.
